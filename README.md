Exercise 07

Takeaways:

Today, I learned how to build a simple web application using Express.js and Node.js. I implemented a basic server that serves static files and handles form submissions. Additionally, I used JavaScript to dynamically create and manage food card elements with ranking functionality. I practiced manipulating the DOM, handling form events, and dynamically updating the UI.
